# Event Guest List Manager

A simple, web application that lets you manage a guest list for any event. Add guests, categorize them, track attendance, and remove them — all without refreshing the page.

This challenge showcases DOM manipulation, event handling, and a beautifully styled UI using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

### Functionality
- Add guest names using a form input
- Display guests in a dynamic list
- Remove guests individually with a button
- Prevent page reload using `event.preventDefault()`

### Features
- Categorize guests as Friend, Family, or Colleague with colored tags
- Toggle RSVP status (Attending / Not Attending)
- Limit guest list to 10 people — alert if the limit is reached
- Show the time each guest was added
- Colorful and animated background using CSS
